# Machine Learning for Beginners

## A list of notebooks I am using to revise the most commonly used machine learning algorithms 

In this repository, you will find notebooks to help you get started with machine learning. Note that this is a beginner's guide, so only fundamental concepts will be covered. The Data used for each notebook is within each model's directory.

- [Logistic Regression](/Logistic%20Regression/)
- [Decision Trees](/Decision%20Trees/)

## Set up

If you want to work on the notebooks yourself, use the following commands to run them locally:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eugenebaraka/Machine-Learning-for-beginners.git
cd Machine-Learning-for-beginners
```
If you are using jupyter notebook as your IDE, run this to open working directory in jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Otherwise, open the working directory in your preferred IDE. 

## Spot a mistake or want to add a beginner-friendly ML model tutorial?
